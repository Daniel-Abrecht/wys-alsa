Description: A daemon to start/stop PulseAudio loopbacks for phone call audio
  During a phone call, audio must be streamed from one ALSA device to
  another ALSA device.  This should only happen during the call, when
  the modem's audio interfaces will actually be active. To facilitate
  this, Wys will wait for ModemManager calls in the ringing or active
  state and enable appropriate PulseAudio loopback modules only during
  those states.
